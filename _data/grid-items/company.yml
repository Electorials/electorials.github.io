# When adding more pages to this file, make sure to add in the information as how they are here.
# Make sure to create a new page in /reviews/company/ with the name being *exactly* as it is in `link`, followed by the ".html" file extension.

# If text for `name` already has a " (double-quote) character, use the ' (single-quote character) to surround the whole value of 'name'.
# Quotes are needed to keep the colons and possibly any other non-alphanumeric characters in `name` from being interpreted.
