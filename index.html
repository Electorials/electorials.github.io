        <li>Introduction - a brief explanation on important aspects of a project (materials, functions, etc.)</li>
        <li>Circuit diagram and schematics of the project (Fritzing)</li>
        <li>The code of the project</li>
        <li>An explanation about the code</li>
    </ol>

    <p>There might be additional content to various projects depending on whether that extra piece of information is sufficient and necessary.</p>
