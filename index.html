    <h2>An introduction to our website</h2>

    <p>Electorials was established on the 2nd of March, 2017 as a hobby. Our goal was to provide an easy, convenient project site for the Arduino community to share. We aim to establish as a one-stop destination for any of your electronic tutorial needs over time.<br>
    Our site is a non-profit making organisation which relies on free web hosting and components are sponsored from time to time for our unbiased review. Feel free to share our projects, tutorials and reviews. We welcome any free sponsors, comments and suggestions in order for us to improve the site content.<br>

    <h2>A Guide to our Projects</h2>

    <p>Our Arduino projects offer a wide variety of content for the whole community. There are projects for beginners to advanced makers. In each project, we include pictures of the real circuit working and the components. We set up our projects in this style:</p>

    <ol>
        <li>Introduction - a brief explanation on important aspects of a project (materials, functions, etc.)</li>
        <li>Circuit diagram and schematics of the project (Fritzing)</li>
        <li>The code of the project</li>
        <li>An explanation about the code</li>
    </ol>

    <p>There might be additional content to various projects depending on whether that extra piece of information is sufficient and necessary.</p>
