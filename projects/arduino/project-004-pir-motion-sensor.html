    <p>Now, that you know a little bit about this project, let's begin with the hardware side. Remember to always unplug the power supply and disconnect any circuits from the current Arduino board.</p>

    <ol>
        <li>First of all, plug all three female pins to the PIR Motion Sensor.</li>
        <li>Then, connect the positive (+) pin of the sensor to 5v (+5 volts) of your Arduino, the ground (-) pin of your sensor to GND (-) on your Arduino, and the output pin of the sensor to the D9 (digital pin 9) on your Arduino.</li>
        <li>Next, connect a LED with the cathode leg going to the GND (-) on your Arduino and the anode of the LED to D13 (digital pin 13) on your Arduino.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>Once all of the connections have been done, you are ready to go onto the software side of this project.</p>

	    <pre><code>
    int ledPin = 13;
    int pirPin = 9;
    int val = 0;
    void setup()
    {
      pinMode(ledPin, OUTPUT);
      pinMode(pirPin, INPUT);
    }
    void loop()
    {
      val = digitalRead(pirPin);
      digitalWrite(ledPin, val);

    if (val ==1)
      digitalWrite(ledPin, LOW);
    }

    <h3>About the code</h3>

    <p>The code is very easy to read because it uses an easy language and easy writing to understand.</p>

    <p>The first three lines of the Code starts with declaration of variables from hardware such as the <i>LED</i> uses pin 13 and the <i>PIR</i> Sensor uses pin 9. The value uses pin 0 because it is the receive pin.</p>

    <p>Next, is the usual <i>void setup</i> which indicates the first part of the Code, that describes the LED as <i>OUTPUT</i> (off). It also means the PIR Sensor is <i>INPUT</i> (on).</p>

    <p>Lastly, the <i>void loop</i> phrase loops the value first as we've mention in the beginning. <i>Value</i> in this line means that it will read the <i>PIR Sensor</i> and give information to the microcontroller on the next step in the process. The last line is the last step and will be repeated with the second last line.</p>

    <p>Our main line is the last line because it outputs the whole code and reacts to the information its given, the <i>LED</i> is turned off.</p>
