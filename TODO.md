Plans and to-dos for the site.

- [ ] Company shoutouts will go on *Company Reviews* page, with a dedicated section to those companies given shoutouts.
- [ ] URLs might be prefixed or suffixed with "shoutout", but will still follow the /review/company/*company-review* scheme.

- [ ] Use the `display: block` method for the links in the navbar, as done for the footer links.
